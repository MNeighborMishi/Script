    "{size=16}{color=#f00}August 10th{/color}- My parents are on vacation and Ni has been over... I used to wonder how far the
     extent of our affection for each other would go. We have always been so very fascinated with one another ever
     since we were young, and now when we are, we can express ourselves fully. Its been over a week since my
     cousin came over and he has been embracing me daily until in a fit of passion we--It seems Ni will never grow weary
     of me--we feel \"pleasant\" together. I didn't say no... but it was indecent to do it there.{/size}"

    "{size=16}{color=#f00}August 11th{/color}- Weather throughout the day: Dark, Stormy, Cold\n
     Have you ever heard that when it rains, the sky cries for all the departed? Today, I, like the weather was moody, I was fairly
     irritated when Ni said he was going to do his homework. However... my mood morphed into a delerious and elated pleasure
     when Ni asked me for help; {color=#f00}I feel soooooooo special!{/color}\n I must admit that it was childish for me to get angry at Ni,
     I at first thought that his homework would ruin our fun together, even through we were apart in previous days. 
     What an odd thought. Maybe this mood is the result of what we did, we obtained a new level in expression and I have become clingy. I need Ni.
     I was soo excited when I noticed Ni's mood shift a quarter of the way through the homework, he stared
     doting and rubbing me... eventually.. we did it again. And again. And again. Maybe that was his intention from the start."
